This directory contains patches against components that crosstool-NG
uses during compilation.

The layout of this directory mirrors that of the crosstool-ng/patches
directory.

The use of this directory is enabled by the crosstool-ng configuration
options CT_PATCH_BUNDLED_FALLBACK_LOCAL and CT_LOCAL_PATCH_DIR.

Using this mechanism avoids patching crosstool-ng directly.
